WeightedSelection

Php implementation of weighted selection

Two classes that handle the same problem differently ported from two different languages.
This serves as the dice roller for the loot system in the gamification platform.
The javascript based port expects doubles with the highest number being 1.0 and the lowest 0. It is fixed to 2 points after the decimal.
So to get a 80% chance you'd put 0.8 and 1% as 0.01 for the javascript port. The comment on top say which language port it is and the site it was taken from.
