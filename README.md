WeightedSelection
=================

Php implementation of weighted selection

Weighted Selection implemented in php. Weighted selection gives you the ability to make a selection based on weight or probability. Each class only accepts integers (floats or doubles not supported at this time). The lowest and highest percents are 1 and 100. Two test files (poorly writen sorry) are here that show metrics based on a sample. Each algorithm performs well but the weightedSelection's subtraction method is the faster of the two. Each give similar metrics on a run for 10,000 times. This will serve as the dice roller for the loot component to the rpg gamification platform. The exception was removed from the constructor and the code simplified and worked so that it will run.
